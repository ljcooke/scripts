ljc-dither-wallpaper - low-res wallpaper creator
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBljc-dither-wallpaper\fR
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBljc-dither-wallpaper\fR is a low-res wallpaper creator.\&
It reads images from a directory
and applies a 16-color dither effect.\&
.P
.SH USAGE
.P
Create a directory named \fBinput\fR and drop some images into it.\&
Example:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
$ tree
\&.
└── input
    └── hello\&.jpg
.fi
.RE
.P
Run \fBljc-dither-wallpaper\fR from the parent directory,
then observe the results in the \fBoutput\fR directory.\&
Example:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
$ ljc-dither-wallpaper
$ tree
\&.
├── input
│   └── hello\&.jpg
└── output
    └── hello\&.jpg~16c@4x\&.png
.fi
.RE
.P
Each image is resized and cropped to fill a small canvas,
then scaled up 400% with nearest-neighbour resizing.\&
By default, images are resized to 720x450,
then scaled up to 2880x1800.\&
You can change the size by setting the environment variable \fIDITHER_SIZE\fR
to a value of the form \fBWxH\fR, where \fBW\fR and \fBH\fR
are 1/4 of the final width and height respectively.\&
.P
Override the number of colors
by setting the \fIDITHER_COLORS\fR environment variable
(default 16, max 256).\&
This can be a space-separated list,
to generate multiple images with different palettes.\&
.P
.SH EXAMPLES
.P
Generate images for a screen resolution of 1920x1080
(or 4x480 by 4x270):
.P
.nf
.RS 4
DITHER_SIZE=480x270 ljc-dither-wallpaper
.fi
.RE
