.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBljc-dither-wallpaper\fR is a low-res wallpaper creator.\&
It reads images from a directory
and applies a 16-color dither effect.\&

Create a directory named \fBinput\fR and drop some images into it.\&
Example:
.P
.nf

Each image is resized and cropped to 720x450,
then scaled up 400% to match a screen resolution of 2880x1800.\&
You can change the size
by setting the environment variable \fIDITHER_SIZE\fR
to a value of the form \fBWxH\fR, where \fBW\fR and \fBH\fR
are 1/4 of the desired width and height respectively.\&
.P
Override the number of colors
by setting the \fIDITHER_COLORS\fR environment variable
(default 16, max 256).\&
This can be a space-separated list,
to generate multiple images with different palettes.\&
