.SH NAME

ljc-curl-resolve - make a HTTP request without DNS
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBljc-curl-resolve\fR [\fB-h\fR] \fIip_address\fR \fIdomain\fR [\fIurl\fR]
.P
\fB-h\fR	Print a help message and exit.\&

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBljc-curl-resolve\fR is a tool to make HTTP requests without going through DNS.\&
.P
It'\&s a wrapper for \fBcurl\fR(1), designed for one use case:
testing that a web server is configured correctly before setting up DNS.\&
.P
Provide an \fIip_address\fR and a \fIdomain\fR, and it will make a HTTP request as
though the domain were configured to resolve to that IP address.\&
This is similar to adding an entry to /etc/hosts.\&
.P
You can also provide a full \fIurl\fR to request from that domain.\&
.P
.SH EXAMPLES
.P
Suppose you are setting up a web server with the IP address 12.\&34.\&56.\&78, and you
have configured it to serve HTTP requests for your new domain, example.\&com.\&
Make a HTTP request with the command:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
ljc-curl-resolve 12\&.34\&.56\&.78 example\&.com
.fi
.RE
.P
You can specify a full URL after the domain:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
ljc-curl-resolve 12\&.34\&.56\&.78 example\&.com http://example\&.com/test\&.html
.fi
