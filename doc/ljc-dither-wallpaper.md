# NAME

ljc-dither-wallpaper - low-res wallpaper creator

# SYNOPSIS

**ljc-dither-wallpaper**

# DESCRIPTION

**ljc-dither-wallpaper** is a low-res wallpaper creator. It reads images
from a directory and applies a 16-color dither effect.

# USAGE

Create a directory named **input** and drop some images into it.
Example:

    $ tree
    .
    └── input
        └── hello.jpg

Run **ljc-dither-wallpaper** from the parent directory, then observe the
results in the **output** directory. Example:

    $ ljc-dither-wallpaper
    $ tree
    .
    ├── input
    │   └── hello.jpg
    └── output
        └── hello.jpg~16c@4x.png

Each image is resized and cropped to fill a small canvas, then scaled up
400% with nearest-neighbour resizing. By default, images are resized to
720x450, then scaled up to 2880x1800.

# ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables affect the execution of
**ljc-dither-wallpaper**:

**DITHER_COLORS**

> Override the number of colors (default **16**, maximum **256**). This
> may be set to a space-separated list, to generate multiple images with
> different palettes.

**DITHER_SIZE**

> Change the image size. Set this to a value of the form **WxH**, where
> **W** and **H** are one quarter of the final width and height
> respectively.

# EXAMPLES

Generate one 4-color image and one 16-color image for each source image:

    $ DITHER_COLORS='4 16' ljc-dither-wallpaper

Generate images for a screen resolution of 1920x1080 (i.e 4x480 width
and 4x270 height):

    $ DITHER_SIZE=480x270 ljc-dither-wallpaper
